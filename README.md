SkelaProfile
============

This is a basic starter profile that tries to be as agnostic as possible, yet providing a quick start. It is fully responsive, based on [Skela](https://github.com/gresakg/Skela) and preserves it's core principles.

It includes a dynamic and responsive navigation bar, and a solution for widget areas with one widgetized sidebar already in place as an example. For the moment, only a plain text widget template is available but others are hopefully to follow.

It is meant as a quick start for new projects, developped and maintained by [gresak.net](http://gresak.net), and free to use under [GPL V. 2.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)
