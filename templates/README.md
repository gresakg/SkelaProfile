# Skela
### A simple boilerplate to start web projects

Skela is a collection of libraries you will probably need for an average web frontend. I have chosen this librairies according to my experience and my everyday needs.

The goal of Skela is to be responsive and cross browser compatible including IE 7.

*Skela* means scaffold in bosnian construction jargon.

### Included librairies

The main part of the project is a fork of [dmur's fork of Skeleton](https://github.com/dmur/Skeleton) merged with the fluid branch so that it has both 960 and fluid grid options.

Other librairies are:

* common [jquery v.1.10.2](http://jquery.com/download/)
* my branch of [Dropdowns](https://github.com/gresakg/dropdowns)
* my branch of [leanModal.js](https://github.com/gresakg/leanModal.js)
* my own project [Share Free](https://github.com/gresakg/ShareFree)
* the beautifull [jQuery Cycle2](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/)

And more will come.

There's no documentation at this point, but you can consult documentation of each respective project.

Nothing except the skeleton and jquery is called by default making the base page super light. You include just what you need to.
